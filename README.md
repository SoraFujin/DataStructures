DataStructures
Overview
This project aims to implement various data structures in Java. The main objective is to understand and efficiently implement any kind of data structure. Future additions will include more data structures as they are learned. The project will also be replicated in other programming languages such as C and Python.

LinkedList
Singly LinkedList
Methods:

add - Adds data at the head of the linked list.
addSorted - Inserts data in a sorted manner.
reverse - Reverses the nodes in the list.
search - Checks if the data exists in the list.
delete - Deletes specific data from the list.
traverse - Prints the data in the list.
Doubly LinkedList
Methods:

addAtHead - Inserts data at the head.
addAtTail - Inserts data at the end of the list.
delete - Deletes data from the list.
addSorted - Inserts data in a sorted manner.
Trees
Binary Search Tree (BST)
AVL Tree

Notes
The main programming language used here is Java. This project is designed to provide a thorough understanding of data structures and their implementations. A shell script Makefile is provided to simplify running the Java classes.
