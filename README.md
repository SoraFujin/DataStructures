Implementing all the data structures I have Learned so far

DataStructures:

LinkedList:
    - singly LinkedList
    - doubly LinkedList

Trees:
    - BST (Biary Search Tree)
    - AVL

Stack:
    - Stack using a LinkedList
    - Stack using a Tree

Queue:
    - Queue using an array
    - Queue using a LinkedList
    - Queue using a Tree
    - Queue using a Stack

Priority Queue:
    - using a LinkedList
    - using a Stack

HashMap:
    - HashMap using an array
    - HashMap using a LinkedList

The main programming language that will be used here is java,

The main objective of this project is to be able to understand and implement any kind of DataStructures, Later on will be adding more DataStructures I learn along the way

This project will be repeated in different langauges, such as, c, and python

Note: the Makefile here is a sh script I created to make it easy to run the Main class for java.
