<h3>Implementing all the data structures I have Learned so far</h3>

<h2>DataStructures:</h2>

### LinkedList:
- Singly LinkedList
 ## Methods:
 1. add -> keeps adding the data at the head of the linked list.
 2. addSorted -> inserts the data sorted.
 3. reverse -> reverse the nodes in the list.
 4. search -> checks if the data is inside the list.
 5. delete -> deletes a specific data in the list.
- Doubly LinkedList

### Trees:
- BST (Biary Search Tree)
- AVL

### Stack:
- Stack using a LinkedList
- Stack using an Array

### Queue:
- Queue using an array
- Queue using a LinkedList
- Queue using a Tree
- Queue using a Stack

### Priority Queue:
- using a LinkedList
- using a Stack

### HashMap:
- HashMap using an array
- HashMap using a LinkedList

The main programming language that will be used here is java,

The main objective of this project is to be able to understand and implement any kind of DataStructures, Later on will be adding more DataStructures I learn along the way

This project will be repeated in different langauges, such as, c, and python

Note: the Makefile here is a sh script I created to make it easy to run the class for java.
