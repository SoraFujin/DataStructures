# Data Structures
=======
<h3>Implementing all the data structures I have Learned so far</h3>

## Overview
This project aims to implement various data structures in Java. The main objective is to understand and efficiently implement any kind of data structure. Future additions will include more data structures as they are learned. The project will also be replicated in other programming languages such as C and Python.

## LinkedList

### Singly LinkedList
**Methods:**
1. **add** - Adds data at the head of the linked list.
2. **addSorted** - Inserts data in a sorted manner.
3. **reverse** - Reverses the nodes in the list.
4. **search** - Checks if the data exists in the list.
5. **delete** - Deletes specific data from the list.
6. **traverse** - Prints the data in the list.

### Doubly LinkedList
**Methods:**
1. **addAtHead** - Inserts data at the head.
2. **addAtTail** - Inserts data at the end of the list.
3. **delete** - Deletes data from the list.
4. **addSorted** - Inserts data in a sorted manner.

## Trees

### Binary Search Tree (BST)

### AVL Tree

## Stack
- **Stack using a LinkedList**
- **Stack using an Array**

## Queue
- **Queue using an Array**
- **Queue using a LinkedList**
- **Queue using a Tree**
- **Queue using a Stack**

## Priority Queue
- **Priority Queue using a LinkedList**
- **Priority Queue using a Stack**

## HashMap
- **HashMap using an Array**
- **HashMap using a LinkedList**

## Notes
The main programming language used here is Java. This project is designed to provide a thorough understanding of data structures and their implementations. A shell script Makefile is provided to simplify running the Java classes.

Feel free to explore and contribute to this project as it evolves with more data structures and implementations. Happy coding!
